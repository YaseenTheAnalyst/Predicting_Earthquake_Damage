# *Earthquake Damage Prediction Project*

## Overview
This project aims to predict earthquake damage in Nepal using machine learning models, specifically Logistic Regression and Decision Tree. The dataset includes information about building structures in Nepal, and the models are trained to predict the severity of damage caused by earthquakes.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing data analysis, model training, and visualization.
- `data/`: Data files used in the project.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for any custom functions or preprocessing steps.
- `models/`: Saved model files.
- `images/`: Visualizations or images generated during analysis.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YaseenTheAnalyst/Predicting_Earthquake_Damage
   cd Predicting_Earthquake_Damage

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Required Python packages listed in requirements.txt

## Model Comparison
- The project includes implementations of Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models. The comparison of these models is detailed in the notebooks.
